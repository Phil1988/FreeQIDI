Why?

QIDIs X-3 series printers are made out of hardware with very good potential, but they do have outdated outdated software. 
Here is a list of software that bottlenecks the full functionality of the printer by time of writing this:
klipper 0.10.0 instead 0.12.0
Armbian Buster instead Bookworm
Python 2.7 instead 3.12

The disk comes prefiled with a lot of unnecessary things. ~6-7GB are used of the 8GB EMMC disk.
This means that additional features or even some GCODE Files will fill your disk space completely.
